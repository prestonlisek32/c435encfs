This is the project for CSCI-C435. The goal is to create a FUSE
filesystem capable of performing md5 checksums and basic encryption.

Run the project like so.

```
$ cd workspace
$ sudo ./c435encfs
$ #Actual files are stored in /workspace/actualdir
$ #Decrypted Files can be accessed in /workspace/mountpoint
```
